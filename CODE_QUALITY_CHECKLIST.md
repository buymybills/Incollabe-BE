## Best Practices Checklist

### Code Organization
- [x] Logical folder structure

- [x] Single responsibility per function
- [x] Minimal parameters (prefer objects)
- [x] No side effects in helpers
- [x] Proper error handling

### Code Comments
- [x] JSDoc for public APIs
- [x] Complex logic explained
- [x] No redundant comments
- [x] TODOs tracked
- [x] Examples provided where helpful
